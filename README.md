This is my personal website!
Currently under development, will probably change frequently until I settle on a design I like.
If you have any feedback or improvements you think I should add, let me know!

Right now I'm using Wordpress just for ease of formatting and editing locally, then exporting to static and pushing to github, but I really don't have a preference one way or another. Open to suggestions!
